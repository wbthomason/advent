# advent

Advent of Code solutions, organized by year. Mostly Python; maybe eventually implementations in more
interesting languages.

## 2017 

I used Python for my 2017 solutions. I became bored with the problems partway through (many of them
seemed to reduce to simulation of a process or otherwise brute-forcing an answer), so not all days
are present. I might come back and finish the rest eventually, but probably not. Any solutions that
_are_ here should be correct and complete.

## 2018

I'm starting using Racket for my 2018 solutions.
